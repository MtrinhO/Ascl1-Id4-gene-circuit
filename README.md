# Ascl1-Id4-gene-circuit
"""A genetic circuit model which is meant to output hippocampal neural stem cell expression of
stem cell activity-regulating gene Ascl1 in vivo. 
This model incorporates the interdependence of Ascl1 expression on genes E47, Id4, Huwe1 for an outptted beta value, representing
the gene expression of the Ascl1 gene and a verdict on how "quiescent" the cell is based on the beta value for Ascl1 expression"""
